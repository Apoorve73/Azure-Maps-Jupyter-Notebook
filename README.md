# Electric Vehicle Routing using Azure Notebooks (Python)

Azure Maps is a portfolio of geospatial APIs natively integrated into Azure enabling developers, enterprises, and ISVs to create location aware apps and IoT, mobility, logistics, and asset tracking solutions. 

In order to perform data analysis, users can call directly Azure Maps REST APIs and visualize Azure Maps data using Python. This repo contains a Azure Jupyter Notebook in Python that implements a routing scenario utilizing Azure Maps REST APIs to get mapping data and visualize it.
